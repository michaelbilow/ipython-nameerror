ipython-nameerror
=================

I'm getting a NameError that strikes me (and at least one person who know more than I do
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12304847/ipython-parallel-computing-namespace-issues])
as weird. Any help is appreciated; I'm completely naive at this, so I apologize if
this is challenging to work with.
